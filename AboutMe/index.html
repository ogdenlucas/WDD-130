    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <h2>Lucas Ogden</h2>
    <p>My name is Lucas Ogden and I am a recent graduate of BYU-Pathway Worldwide. I am looking forward to
       learning about web development and seeing what I can do with it. I am pursuing certificates in both
       mainline computer programming as well as web development. I have been a member of the Church since I was 8
       years old.
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: I did the best I could on the picture part, but somehow, I couldn't figure it out. Please help
       so that I can learn how to do this in the future.
    </p>
