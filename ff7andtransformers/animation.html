Ride with us as the Autobots, together with the forces of the WRO, or World Regenesis Organization, and the mercenary group known as AVALANCHE, fight for the freedom of the whole human race against the evil Decepticons and their allies, the Sons of Jenova! It's a world where the unexpected merges with the divine, where the mighty, the mad, and the magical will have their final battle, and where the forces of darkness, while they may seem powerful, will never be allowed to bask in the light of the forces of good! It's a world beyond your experience! It's a world beyond your imagination!</p>

                <p>This show and movie will include animation that is realistic, but not so much so that the audience will suddenly get nervous. As such, the animation style will be reminiscent of the 1980s.</p>
