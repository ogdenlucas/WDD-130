      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my site is to show my idea for a TV show involving the legendary (in my eyes, at least) and heroic swordsman Cloud Strife, the main character of the widely renowned and popular video game Final Fantasy VII (or 7 if you're not into Roman numerals). The story follows Cloud as he continuously battles against his arch-nemesis Sephiroth in order to prevent Sephiroth from completing his goal of destroying all life. Cloud is aided in this conflict by his friends in the group known as AVALANCHE. Cloud's other allies include Tifa Lockhart, who, by this time, has married him and is a part of AVALANCHE, his adopted son Denzel, who was orphaned after his parents died of the Geostigma, his friend, Barret Wallace, who is his chief lieutenant, and his (supposedly) illegitimate brother, Rufus Shinra, who is the president of the Shinra Electric Power Company, along with everyone involved with Shinra. His other allies are Cid Highwind, Red XIII, Cait Sith (who doesn't appear here), Vincent Valentine, and Yuffie Kisaragi. The battle between Cloud and Sephiroth has, understandably, cost a lot, but Cloud will not rest until Sephiroth is completely destroyed. This idea for a TV show, and movie, follows Cloud as he finds allies in, and joins forces with, the Autobots, while, at the same time, introducing them to his allies and enlisting them in the battle against Sephiroth. This TV show takes place in the world of The Transformers, specifically the original series as well as the spinoff shows "Robots in Disguise" and "Transformers: Prime."</p>
